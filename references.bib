                 classes of parallel machines, especially these with
                 distributed memory. Although there are many variations,
                 the basic concept of processes communicating through
                 messages is well understood. Over the last ten years,
                 substantial progress has been made in casting
                 significant applications in this paradigm. Each vendor
                 has implemented its own variant. More recently, several
                 systems have demonstrated that a message-passing system
                 can be efficiently and portably implemented. A
                 definition of both the syntax and semantics of a core
                 of library routines is thus presented. It will be
                 useful to a wide range of users and efficiently
                 implementable on a wide range of computers.",
