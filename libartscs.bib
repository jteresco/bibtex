Information about the task force and preliminary drafts of the Knowledge Areas that will be included in the guidelines can be found online at http://csed.acm.org. To assist institutions in applying the new guidelines, CS202X will also publish a Curricular Practices Volume. This volume will include an article by the SIGCSE Committee on Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges (SIGCSE-LAC Committee) that will focus on designing or revising CS curricula in liberal arts contexts. Liberal arts colleges, and smaller colleges in general, face unique challenges when designing curricula. Small faculty sizes, limits on the number of courses that can be required for a major and the need for flexibility in student programs of study constrain designs. However, these environments also provide the opportunity to craft distinctive curricula fitted to institutional mission, departmental strengths, locale, student populations and unique academic experiences. These challenges and opportunities, combined with the size of prior curricular recommendations, have often forced smaller programs to assess trade-offs between achieving full coverage of curricular recommendations and their other priorities.The SIGCSE-LAC Committee has heard from many faculty that their institutional and departmental contexts have indeed complicated the adoption of prior curricular guidelines. While the CS2013 and upcoming CS202X recommendations provide some flexibility for curriculum designers by dividing content into core and supplemental categories, smaller colleges still face challenges selecting content and packaging it into coherent curricula. To assist in this process, the committee is developing guidance for effectively integrating CS202X as a part of the design, evaluation and revision of computer science and related programs in the liberal arts. This guidance will encourage faculty to reflect on their programs and the role of CS202X, beginning with their institutional and departmental priorities, opportunities and constraints. Ultimately, this guidance will be presented in the committee's article in the CS202X Curricular Practices volume.This session will open with an overview and brief discussion of the current CS202X draft. Participants will then begin working through a preliminary version of the committees' reflective assessment process. This process is framed by a series of scaffolding questions that begin from institutional and departmental missions, identities, contexts, priorities, initiatives, opportunities, and constraints. From there, participants will be led to identify design principles for guiding their curricular choices including the CS202X recommendations. Participants will leave the session with a better understanding of how CS202X can impact their programs and a jumpstart on the reflective assessment process. Feedback on the process and this session are welcome and will be used to refine the committee's guidance prior to its publication in the CS202X Curricular Practices volume.},

SIGCSE-LAC's guidance will encourage faculty to reflect on their programs and the role of CS2023, beginning with their institutional and departmental priorities, opportunities and constraints. The specific goal of this session is to help participants develop programlevel learning outcomes that align with the unique features of their programs. Following an overview and brief discussion of the newest CS2023 draft, participants will begin working through a preliminary version of the committee's reflective assessment process. This process is framed by a series of scaffolding questions that begin from institutional and departmental missions, identities, contexts, priorities, initiatives, opportunities, and constraints. From there, participants will be led to identify design principles for guiding their curricular choices including the CS2023 recommendations. Examples gathered from the committee's previous CCSC and SIGCSE sessions will be available to help to articulate identity and program design principles, which will then be used for the identification of identity-focused program-level learning outcomes. Participants will leave the session with a better understanding of how CS2023 can impact their programs and a jumpstart on the entire reflective assessment process.
